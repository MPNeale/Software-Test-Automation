    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    
        Testing can make sure everything is functional. By testing each component thoroughly I can ensure that each part is functional and working properly. Testing can also make sure everything is secure. If everything is functional and has been thoroughly tested then there is no room for error or fatal crashes.
        
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    
        Each user need can be interpreted as a function or requirement of the program. There should be specific methods within the program to fulfill all the user needs.
      
    How do I approach designing software?
    
        I start with a list of requirements that the program needs to be able to do. Next I work through them one at a time and test them for functionality. When I am satisfied that each component has been tested and is functional I can all the program version complete.
